## About this Book
The Arm Cortex-M processors are already one of the most popular choices for loT and embedded applications, with over 45 billion chips shipped worldwide to date. Written by Arm Distinguished Engineer Joseph Yiu, this reference book takes an expert look at all the key topics that System-on-Chip (SoC) and FPGA designers need to know when incorporating Cortex-M processors into their designs.

It discusses on-chip bus protocol specifications (AMBA, AHB, and APB), used by Arm processors and a wide range of on-chip digital components such as memory interfaces, peripherals, and debug components. Software development and advanced design considerations are also covered. It concludes with ‘Putting the system together’, a designer’s eye view of a simple microcontroller-like design based on the Cortex-M3 processor.
