## About this Book
The Arm Cortex-M processors are already one of the most popular choices for loT and embedded applications, with over 45 billion chips shipped worldwide to date. Written by Arm Distinguished Engineer Joseph Yiu, this reference book takes an expert look at all the key topics that System-on-Chip (SoC) and FPGA designers need to know when incorporating Cortex-M processors into their designs.

It discusses on-chip bus protocol specifications (AMBA, AHB, and APB), used by Arm processors and a wide range of on-chip digital components such as memory interfaces, peripherals, and debug components. Software development and advanced design considerations are also covered. It concludes with ‘Putting the system together’, a designer’s eye view of a simple microcontroller-like design based on the Cortex-M3 processor.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This book contains references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms at the next edition and as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
